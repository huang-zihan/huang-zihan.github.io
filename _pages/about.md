I graguated from Turing Class, Chu Kochen Honors College of Zhejiang University. My research interest lies in Multimodality, LLMs, Machine Learning and its Application. During my undergraduate, I colaborated with professor Fei Wu, Jingyuan Chen at Zhejiang University and professor Pengtao Xie at University of California San Diego.

[AutoGeo: Automating Geometric Image Dataset Creation for Enhanced Geometry Understanding, NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Under Review)](https://autogeo-official.github.io/)

**Zihan Huang**, Tao Wu, Wang Lin, Shengyu Zhang, Jingyuan Chen, Fei Wu

- We created a tool to automatically generate various images of geometry figures and their corresponding natural language descriptions.
- We generate a datasets AutoGeo-100K and use it for multi-modal LLMs alignment training and verify the reliable of our datasets through this.

Mengze Li, **Zihan Huang**, Ziqi Tan, Zhengqing Fang, Zhou Zhao, Kun Kuang, Shengyu Zhang, Fei Wu

- We created an framework based on differential privacy to filter privacy information in data while training captioning model. 
- The evaluation result of our framework PDD shows that we can add more privacy protection for models while keeping maintaining better model usability compared with other methods.

Mengze Li, **Zihan Huang**, Han Wang, Jiaxu Miao, Wenyan Fan, Zhou Zhao, Shengyu Zhang, Wenming Tan, Fei Wu

- We created an system with causal disentanglement to retrieve videos of different data distribution by natural language discription of their contents. 
- The result and case study shows of our systems can retrieve videos with differnent senarios robustly.
- We provides a datasets with various videos from life and movie to better evaluate our system and for research in this area.
