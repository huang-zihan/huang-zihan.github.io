[Private Data protected Distillation model for image captioning via multi-teachers latent space feature aggregation]()
Mengze Li‚àó, **Zihan Huang‚àó**, Ziqi Tan, Zhengqing Fang, Zhou Zhao, Kun Kuang, Shengyu Zhang, Fei Wu
( * equal contribution)

- We created an framework based on differential privacy to filter privacy information in data while training captioning model. 
- The evaluation result of our framework PDD shows that we can add more privacy protection for models while keeping maintaining better model usability compared with other methods.

[TITAN: Test-tIme Training via counterfactuAl generation and casual interventioN for text-video retrieval]()
Mengze Li‚àó, **Zihan Huang‚àó**, Han Wang‚àó, Jiaxu Miao, Wenyan Fan, Zhou Zhao, Shengyu Zhang, Wenming Tan, Fei Wu
( * equal contribution)

- We created an system with causal disentanglement to retrieve videos of different data distribution by natural language discription of their contents. 
- The result and case study shows of our systems can retrieve videos with differnent senarios robustly.
- We provides a datasets with various videos from life and movie to better evaluate our system and for research in this area.
